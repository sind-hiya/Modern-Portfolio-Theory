Features:

Calculation of Expected Return and Risk: Functions to calculate the expected return and risk associated with a portfolio, using the set of stocks and their respective weightings.

Efficient Frontier Visualization: Plots the Efficient Frontier using the aforementioned functions.

Optimal Weighting Calculation: A function to determine the optimal weightings of a given set of stocks to maximize the overall expected return of the portfolio.
